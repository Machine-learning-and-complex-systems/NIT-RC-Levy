# NIT-RC-Levy

This is the code repository for the research paper: "Multi-scaling reservoir computing learns noise-induced transitions with
Lévy noise".

We extend the multi-scaling RC method to the case of stochastic differential equations with Lévy noise and limit cycle system.

This repository contains:
- Jupyter notebook demonstration in the Demo folder (one-dimensional bistable system with Lévy noise.ipynb, 2D limit cycle.ipynb). Because the random matrices in RC require random number generation, the results may vary slightly when run on different devices.
- Source code for figure generation in the research paper
- Experimental datasets (npy format)

More details about multi-scaling RC can be found in the repository: https://github.com/Machine-learning-and-complex-systems/NIT-RC.

# NIT-RC-Levy

This is the code repository for the research paper: "Multi-scaling reservoir computing learns noise-induced transitions with
Lévy noise".

We extend the multi-scaling RC method to the case of stochastic differential equations with Lévy noise and limit cycle system.

This repository contains:
- Jupyter notebook demonstration in the Demo folder (one-dimensional bistable system with Lévy noise.ipynb, 2D limit cycle.ipynb). Note that due to the random matrices in RC, results may vary slightly across different devices and environments (see the 1D Levy folder in Demo for examples).
- Source code for figure generation in the research paper
- Experimental datasets (npy format)

More details about multi-scaling RC can be found in the repository: https://github.com/Machine-learning-and-complex-systems/NIT-RC.
